# Database description
I am choosing to make Real Estate Property Information database. I am motivated to create this database because I want to invest in real estate right after I graduate. I want to make a private database for myself because there are so many properties in the market that come and go each day. I want to keep track of each property I review using database.

Each property has a offering memorandum, each of which has a unique property id, address, city, state, and listing date. The offering memorandum has so much valuable information about the property. In order to make detailed database, properties are seperated into two categories one being commercial and other residential. Many different types of properties fall into commercial and residential. To keep the track of properties currently in the market, broker's name, phone, and email is recorded inroder to contact them for property related information. The database will contain deep report for each category which includes property information and financial information. Property information contains square feet, price per foot, lot size, year built, and building class. Financial information contains price of the property, cap rate, and net operating income. Each property will have at least one report but it can have more than one report depending on the changes that may occur in the property over some time.
